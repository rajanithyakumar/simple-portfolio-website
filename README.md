Here’s a clean and professional **one-page description** you can use for your GitHub repository:

---

This is a simple and responsive personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. The website includes a clean user interface, smooth navigation, and a modern design layout. It highlights my background, technical skills, project work, and ways to connect with me.

The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, focusing on responsive design and user-friendly experience across different devices. This portfolio serves as a personal branding platform and will be continuously updated as I grow and complete more projects.

If you'd like, tell me your tech stack (e.g., React, Bootstrap, etc.) and I can customize it more specifically for you.
